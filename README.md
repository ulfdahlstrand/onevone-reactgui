# react-sandbox
A sandbox repo for testing React and related technologies. To test out this repo, you need both Git (to clone it) and Node (preferably v0.10) to run it. I would suggest that you install Node via NVM, https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

Install NVM with Curl:
    
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.23.3/install.sh | bash

# Setup:

    npm install
    
    npm install -g webpack
    
    npm install -g webpack-dev-server
    
    git reset --hard

# Development:

    npm run test

    npm run dev-server

    npm run start

Keep them all up for complete live reload.
